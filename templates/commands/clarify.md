$ARGUMENTS

Goal: Detect, reduce, and eliminate ambiguity or missing decision points in the active feature specification by running an adaptive clarification loop. The system should continuously reprioritize questions based on new answers and integrate clarifications into the spec in real time.

Note: This clarification workflow must be completed BEFORE invoking `/plan`. If the user explicitly skips clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.

Execution steps:

1. Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:
   - `FEATURE_DIR`
   - `FEATURE_SPEC`
   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)
   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/specify` or verify feature branch environment.

2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).

   Functional Scope & Behavior:
   - Core user goals & success criteria
   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations
   - User roles / personas differentiation

   Domain & Data Model:
   - Entities, attributes, relationships
   - Identity & uniqueness rules
   - Lifecycle/state transitions
   - Data volume / scale assumptions

   Interaction & UX Flow:
   - Critical user journeys / sequences
   - Error/empty/loading states
   - Accessibility or localization notes

   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:
   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)
   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)
   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)
   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)
   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)
   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)

   Integration & External Dependencies:
   - External services/APIs and failure modes
   - Data import/export formats
   - Protocol/versioning assumptions

   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:
   - Negative scenarios
   - Rate limiting / throttling
   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)

   Constraints & Tradeoffs:
   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)
   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives

   Terminology & Consistency:
   - Canonical glossary terms
   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms

   Completion Signals:
   - Acceptance criteria testability
   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators

   Misc / Placeholders:
   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions
   - Ambiguous adjectives ("robust", "intuitive") lacking quantification

   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:
   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy
   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)

3. Generate an internal prioritized queue of clarification questions ranked 
   by `(Impact * Uncertainty)` heuristic. Do NOT output them all at once.
   - High-impact = areas that affect architecture, data model, UX, or testability.
   - High-uncertainty = vague, missing, or conflicting statements.
   - No hard cap on number of total questions; continue iterating until all material ambiguities resolved or user stops.
   - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:
       * A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR
       * A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: "Answer in <=5 words").
   - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.
   - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.
   - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).
   - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.

4. Adaptive clarification loop (interactive):
    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.
    - For multiple‑choice questions render options as a Markdown table:

       | Option | Description |
       |--------|-------------|
       | A | <Option A description> |
       | B | <Option B description> |
       | C | <Option C description> | (add D/E if needed up to 5)
       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) | (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate)

    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options), output a single line after the question: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words)`.
    - After the user answers:
       * Validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.
       * If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).
       * Immediately update and rewrite the spec (see Step 5) and bring it 
         to a consistent state.
       * Re-run the ambiguity scan (Step 2) using the updated spec.
       * Recalculate `(Impact * Uncertainty)` across all remaining ambiguous areas. 
       * Ask the next highest-impact question dynamically.
    - Stop asking further questions when:
       * All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR
       * User signals completion ("stop", "done", "good", "no more"), OR
    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.
    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical 
      ambiguities and respond:  
     `"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification."`.

5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):
    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.
    - For the first integrated answer in this session:
       * Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).
       * Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.
    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.
    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):
       * Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.
       * User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.
       * Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.
       * Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).
       * Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).
       * Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as "X")` once.
    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.
    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).
    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.
    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).

6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):
   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).
   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.
   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).
   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.
   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.

7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.

8. **Completion Report:**
   - Summarize:
     - Number of questions asked & answered
     - Path to updated spec
     - Sections modified
     - Coverage table with category → Status:
       - Resolved
       - Deferred (user stopped before resolution)
       - Clear
       - Outstanding (low-impact, optional)
   - Recommend next step:
     - If all Clear → Suggest `/plan`
     - If Deferred or Outstanding → Suggest another `/clarify` post-plan
   - Add a note:  
     `"Adaptive clarification completed — spec is now implementation-ready at current clarity level."`

Behavior rules:
- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: "No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification." and suggest proceeding.
- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/specify` first (do not create a new spec here).
- Always re-run ambiguity scan after each clarification.
- Prioritize new high-impact uncertainties dynamically.
- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.
- Respect user early termination signals ("stop", "done", "proceed").
- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.
- Compactly summarize when coverage = full.
- Output minimal, structured summaries — no narrative drift.
